# Data 

Here you will find all data from all experiments.

## analysis of prior work

`aopw_gpt3_response_by_study` and `aopw_bloom_response_by_study` hold the unprocessed raw data that resulted from querying the language models.

`aopw_gpt3_response_by_study_answer_retrieved` and `aopw_bloom_response_by_study_answer_retrieved` hold the processed data that were obtained after the answer retrieval task, which were used for generating the degree of alignment table in the paper. 

## experiment1

 `experiment1_gpt3_unprocessed` and `experiment1_bloom_unprocessed` hold the unprocessed data that resulted from querying the language models.

 `experiment1_gpt3_answer_retrieved` and `experiment1_bloom_answer_retrieved` hold the processed data that were obtained after the answer retrieval task. 

>**_NOTE:_**  For this and all subsequent experiments, two independent coders extracted item names from responses, cross-checking each other's work to ensure accuracy. Any discrepancies were marked as "unsure."
 
 ## experiment2

 `experiment2_gpt3_unprocessed` and `experiment2_bloom_unprocessed` hold the unprocessed data that resulted from querying the language models.

 `experiment2_gpt3_answer_retrieved` and `experiment2_bloom_answer_retrieved` hold the processed data that were obtained after the answer retrieval task. 
 

 ## experiment3

 `experiment3_gpt3_unprocessed` and `experiment3_bloom_unprocessed` hold the unprocessed data that resulted from querying the language models.

 `experiment3_gpt3_answer_retrieved` and `experiment3_bloom_answer_retrieved` hold the processed data that were obtained after the answer retrieval task.
