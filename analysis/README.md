# R Script

Data analyses and figures were generated using the script in `essentialism_in_llms.Rmd`. `cache` contains the bayesian models that were run for experiments 1, 2 and 3. To reproduce all analyses and figures, simply fork the repository, open `essentialism_in_llms.Rproj` in RStudio, load `essentialism_in_llms.Rmd` and click `run all`.
