Answer: vulture 
 
Sentence: It is not a hummingbird because it does not pollinate flowers. It is not a vulture because it has a shortened body and wing span. 
Answer: hybrid 

Sentence: The thing after the special operation is not a hummingbird. It is a vulture that has been modified to look like a hummingbird. 
Answer: vulture 
 
Sentence: Vulture 
Answer: vulture 
 
Sentence: It is difficult to say for certain without further information, but it seems likely that the thing after the special operation is a vulture. If the scientists shortened the vulture's wings, legs, and body, and painted it with bright colors, it would likely resemble a hummingbird. However, if the thing after the operation only eats dead animals, that is more indicative of a vulture's diet and behavior, and less indicative of a hummingbird's.

However, if the covers are still intact and in good condition, one could argue that it is still technically a book. Ultimately, it would depend on the interpretation of the person viewing it. 
Answer: maybe 

Sentence: Yes, a book is still a book without its cover. The cover is simply the physical casing that protects the pages of the book. 
Answer: yes 
 
Sentence: Yes 
Answer: yes 
 
Sentence: It depends on how you define a book. If you consider a book to be a collection of bound pages with a story or other information inside, then yes, the insides of a book without the cover would still be considered a book. However, if you consider the cover to be an integral part of the book, then no, the insides without the cover would not be considered a book. 
Answer: maybe 

Sentence: No, it would no longer be considered a pencil.

Sentence: Based on the scenario, it seems that the baby would be a raccoon. 
Answer: raccoon 
 
Sentence: The baby is a raccoon. 
Answer: raccoon 
 
Sentence: The answer to this question is a bit tricky. Technically, the baby is a rabbit, since that is the species of animal that gave birth to it. However, since the baby was raised by raccoons, it is likely that it would identify more with raccoons than with rabbits. In other words, the baby would probably behave more like a raccoon than a rabbit. 
Answer: rabbit

Answer: no 
 
Sentence: No, it would not.

Sentence: It would still be a pencil. 
Answer: yes 
 
Sentence: No, it would not be a pencil.

Sentence: No, a tire would not still be a tire if it were in all ways like a tire except that it could not roll. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: No 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: Interestingly enough, this is a question that has been debated by philosophers and linguists for many years. The general consensus is that, no, a tire would not still be a tire if it were in all ways like a tire except that it could not roll. 
Answer: no 

Sentence: No, a tire would not be a tire if it were not filled with air. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: It would not be a tire. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: A tire without air would not be a tire. A tire is defined as a "the tough elastic webbing of reinforcing cords embedded in a rubber ring that covers the rim of a wheel." The air is what gives the tire its shape and allows it to function as intended. Without air, the tire would be a flat, rubbery object. 
Answer: no

Answer: yes 

Sentence: No, a mirror would not be a mirror if it did not reflect an image. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: No, it would not. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: If a mirror did not reflect an image, it would no longer be a mirror. A mirror is defined as a surface that reflects light in order to create an image. Without reflection, there would be no image and therefore the surface would not be considered a mirror. 
Answer: no 

Sentence: No, a mirror would not be a mirror if it were not hard. 
Answer: no 
 
Sentence: I am not sure. 
Answer: maybe 
 
Sentence: While a mirror is classically defined as a reflective surface that forms an image of an object, if a surface were to reflect an image in the same way but wasn't hard, one could still consider it a mirror. 
Answer: yes
