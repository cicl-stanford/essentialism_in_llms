      "Scenario: Some very talented and skilled scientists, Suzy and Andy, decide that they are going to perform a special operation on a queen bee. They removed its wings and antennae, lengthened its legs and added a new pair of legs. They also inserted into the back of it something for making webs and trained the animal so that it would eat insects. After the special operation, this thing looked like a spider. After running some tests, they found that the thing after the special operation didn’t pollinate flowers or make honey. Instead, it only spun webs to catch insects and eat them.\n",
